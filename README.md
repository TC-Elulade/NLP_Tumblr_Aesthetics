# NLP_Project_Repository


My project focuses on testing topic modelling techniques on picture and hashtag data curated from Tumblr.

NOTEBOOK NOTES:
-Original txt file of README is left in the folder for reference.
-Topic modelling cannot work on individual hashtag strings, better suited for the entire dataframe
-LSA was successfully able to extract the relevant images
-LDA is not able to perform in the same way (since query will just be string and cosine similarity cannot really work with bag of words).
